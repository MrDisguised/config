# My archlinux config files
Yes I use arch btw and these are my archlinux config files which will help me to install a fresh arch linux on any computer :) .
## It is under development
I haven't tested the script under a virtual machine to see whether it works or not so if you want to use it **use it at your own risk**. I will be not responsible for any damage caused to your computer **you have been warned!!!!**.
Always follow the [arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org) while installing arch.
